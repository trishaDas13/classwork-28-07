h1 tag : it defines the most important heading. and most bold one.
h2 tag : It defines the second-level headings on this webpage. Like an H1 tag, an H2 tag also appears larger than the rest of the main body text. However, H2 tags are always slightly smaller than H1 tag, so that it does not compete with main heading. 
p tag : The p tag defines a paragraph. We can write paragraph with it.
